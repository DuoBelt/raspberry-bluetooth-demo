I am using Python 2.6 with Numpy. I can confirm that Python 3 is not backward compatible. So I myself am not very confident with upgrading. Have a look at the cookbook to get started

mkdir blue

sudo nano hello-world.py

From the Raspberry Pi desktop, open a new Terminal window.
Type sudo bluetoothctl then press enter and input the administrator password (the default password is raspberry).
Next, enter agent on and press enter. Then type default-agent and press enter.
Type scan on and press enter one more time. The unique addresses of all the Bluetooth devices around the Raspberry Pi will appear and look something like an alphanumeric XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX. If you make the device you want to pair discoverable (or put it into pairing mode), the device nickname may appear to the right of the address. If not, you will have to do a little trial and error or waiting to find the correct device.
To pair the device, type pair [device Bluetooth address]. The command will look something like pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.




//sudo apt-get install emacs
//sudo apt-get install vim
